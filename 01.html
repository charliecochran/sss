				What's a website? And how do I make one?
			</h3>
			<p>
				So there's three basic parts of a typical website. I like to call these parts the <em>Stuff</em>, the <em>Style</em>, and the <em>Spark</em>. I actually made those up just now, but you can't really go wrong with a little alliteration.
			</p>

			<h4>
				The Stuff
			</h4>
			<p>
				Content. All the things you want to say and do and sell and show. Your essays and product descriptions and links and pictures. All of this <em>stuff</em> is written and organized using something called HTML. You might have heard of it. HTML means HyperText Markup Language, and it's really not as scary as it sounds.
			</p>

			<h4>
				The Style
			</h4>
			<p>
				Color and shape. Glamour and glitz. Everything that makes your website look cool or professional or pretty or different. You add styles with CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. If that's too posh for you, you can think of it as your Collection of Super Styles. Or maybe your Cool Style Stash. Or just CSS, since using proper names when you could have used an acronym is so terribly out of fashion.
			</p>

			<h4>
				The Spark
			</h4>
			<p>
				Behavior. Interaction. Whenever a website does something other than sit there looking pretty, that's usually the invisible hand of JavaScript at work. No, it was not made in Indonesia and it has very little to do with writing plays. Though I have heard that writing JavaScript while drinking coffee can you make you feel like the hero of your own personal movie. So there is that.
