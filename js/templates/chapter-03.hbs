<h4>What is a tag?</h4>
<p>
	When I was first learning my greater than and less than comparisons as a child, I was taught that
	<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> were alligator mouths eating the bigger number. So whichever
	way the "mouth" was facing toward was the bigger number. To this day whenever I see one of these
	signs I think "alligator mouth."
</p>
<p>
	A tag in HTML is just a bunch of letters and symbols in between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>.
	So whenever you see something <strong>being eaten by alligators from both ends</strong>, think
	<em>tag</em>:
</p>
<pre class="prettify lang-html">&lt;helpme&gt;</pre>
<p>
	You can make up tags all you like (as I've just done above), but a browser won't know what to do with
	a <code>&lt;helpme&gt;</code> tag, so it will just ignore it. In order for the browser to understand
	what you're saying with a tag, you have to use one of its predefined tags. A browser is kind of like
	a really powerful automated phone system:
</p>
<blockquote>To add a line-break, please press <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.<br>
	To add a picture, please press <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.<br>
	I'm sorry, <code>&lt;helpme&gt;</code> is not a valid option, please try again.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Or something like that.
</p>
<h4>Tags come in <strike style="font-weight:normal;">all</strike> <em>two</em> different shapes and sizes!</h4>

	Typical summer movie, where plot closure is all but guaranteed between the opening and closing credits.
	And Cliffhangers, symbolic of the rugged individualism of the great Wild West of the 1800s, where closure you
	will certainly not receive.
