<h4>What is a tag?</h4>
<p>
	When I was first learning my greater than and less than comparisons as a kid, I was taught that
	<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> were alligator mouths eating the bigger number. So whichever
	way the "mouth" was facing toward was the bigger number. To this day whenever I see one of these
	signs I think "alligator mouth."
</p>
<p>
	A tag in HTML is just a bunch of letters and symbols in between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>.
	So whenever you see something <strong>being eaten by alligators from both ends</strong>, think
	<em>tag</em>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;helpme&gt;</pre>
<p>
	You can make up tags all you like (as I've just done above), but a browser won't know what to do with
	a <code>&lt;helpme&gt;</code> tag, so it will just ignore it. In order for the browser to understand
	what you're saying with a tag, you have to use one of its predefined tags. A browser is kind of like
	a really powerful automated phone system:
</p>
<blockquote>To add a line-break, please press <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.<br>
	To add a picture, please press <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.<br>
	I'm sorry, <code>&lt;helpme&gt;</code> is not a valid option, please try again.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Or something like that. More on this later.
</p>
<h4>Tags come in <strike style="font-weight:normal;">all</strike> <em>two</em> different shapes and sizes!</h4>
<p>
	Most tags are what I like to call <em>sandwich tags</em>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;bun&gt;bacon, lettuce, tomato&lt;/bun&gt;</pre>
<p>
	What you have is an opening tag (<code>&lt;bun&gt;</code>) followed by all the fillings of the tag sandwich
	(<code>bacon, lettuce, tomato</code>) and finished off by the closing tag (<code>&lt;/bun&gt;</code>). The
	slash is how you tell the browser that this tag sandwich is finished and ready to be served to the customer.
	Think of it like the toothpick with the plastic frilly stuff on one end that holds the sandwich
	together&mdash;the finishing touch.
</p>
<blockquote>/ = frilly toothpick</blockquote>
<p>
	The remaining tags are the rugged individualists of the HTML world. Let's call them <em>burrito tags</em>.
	When his high school girlfriend broke up with him suddenly at homecoming, <em>burrito tag</em> didn't call
	her 42 times over the weekend looking for closure. <em>Burrito tag</em> don't need no closure,
	<em>burrito tag</em> closes <em>himself</em>. <em>Burrito tag</em> scoffs at <em>sandwich tag</em>, "Bro,
	why you need them <em>two</em> pieces of bread? Just takes <em>one</em> tortilla, man."
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;burrito&gt;</pre>
<p>
	Unlike sandwiches, burritos don't <em>need</em> frilly toothpicks (they're totally cool with it either way),
	but some chefs still like to put them in their burritos so they don't get mistaken for unfinished sandwiches:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;burrito /&gt;</pre>
<h4>Jargon</h4>
<p>
	Just as sandwiches and burritos fall under the category of <em>food</em>, our <em>sandwich tags</em> and
	<em>burrito tags</em> are collectively known as <em>elements</em>.
</p>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>
	Sometimes when you order a sandwich or burrito, you want to customize your order. To customize
	your sandwich tags and burrito tags, you use <em>attributes</em>, which look something like
	this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;bun toasted="true"&gt;bacon, lettuce, tomato&lt;/bun&gt;
&lt;burrito salsa="mild" sourcream="none" /&gt;</pre>
<p>
	So an attribute is basically a name (<code>salsa</code>) followed by an equals sign (<code>=</code>) followed
	by the <em>value</em> inside a couple of quotes (<code>"mild"</code>). You can use double quotes (<code>"value"</code>)
	or single quotes (<code>'value'</code>), just make sure the opening quotation mark is the same type as the closing
	one:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;quotes double="yep" single='no problem!' /&gt;</pre>
<p>
	Next up, we'll learn about some real life HTML tags that we can use to make our website!
